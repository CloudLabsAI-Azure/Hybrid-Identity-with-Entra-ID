# Lab 5: Setup MFA and Conditional Access

## Lab Overview 
This lab focuses on setting up multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies to enhance security.Initially, per-user MFA is configured for Outlook on the Web via the Microsoft Entra admin center. Then, conditional access policies with MFA are established for Office 365 apps, ensuring secure access. 


## Lab Scenario
In this lab scenario, you are tasked with setting up  heightened security measures required to safeguard sensitive data. By implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies, administrators ensure that only authorized users can access Office 365 apps securely, mitigating risks of unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Exercise 1: Configure per-user multi-factor authentication
  - Task 1: Validate sign-in before enabling MFA
  - Task 2: Enable MFA for a user
  - Task 3: Register and Validate MFA
  - Task 4:Remove per-user MFA 
- Exercise 2: Configure multi-factor authentication using conditional access
  - Task 1: Validate sign-in before enabling conditional access with MFA
  - Task 2: Configure conditional access with MFA
  - Task 3: Validate conditional access MFA
  - Task 4: Remove conditional access MFA 


## Exercise 1: Configure per-user multi-factor authentication

### Task 1: Validate sign-in before enabling MFA

In this task, you are validating the current sign-in process to Outlook on the Web before enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA). You will sign in with just a password, check that MFA is not yet required, and then sign out. This ensures you understand the baseline sign-in experience before introducing MFA.

1. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

2. In the address bar, enter **outlook.office.com** and press Enter.
  
3. At the **Sign in** page, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>** and then select **Next**.

4. If you are prompted to enter the password on the **Enter password** page, enter **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>** and select **Sign in**. At the Edge Save password prompt, select **Save & Turn on**.

5. At the **Stay signed in** prompt, select **No**.

   > Outlook on the Web opens. Take note that only the password was required to sign in to Outlook on the Web.

   >**Note:** If there is a blocker while signing in to Outlook, please wait for sometime and try signing in again.

6. At the top-right corner, select the **Account manager** and then select **Sign out**.

7. Close Microsoft Edge.

### Task 2: Enable MFA for a user

In this task, you will enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for a specific user in Microsoft Entra. You’ll first access the Microsoft Entra admin center, configure MFA settings to allow users to remember trusted devices for 30 days, and then enable MFA for the selected user. After applying these changes, the user will be required to use MFA during sign-in.

1. In **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://entra.microsoft.com**, and then press **Enter**.

2. Sign in as user **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>** and use the tenant Admin password  **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>**. If the **Stay signed in?** prompt appears, select **No**. 

   > The Microsoft Entra admin center opens.

3. At the top of the web page, In the search resources box, type multifactor authentication and then select **multifactor authentication**.

   > The multi-factor authentication page opens.

4. Select **Additional cloud-based multifactor authentication settings**.If prompted to sign in using at the **Sign in** page, select **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>**
