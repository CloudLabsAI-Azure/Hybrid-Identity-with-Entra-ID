    - Select one or more users by selecting the circle next to their names.

    - Select Approve or Deny on the bar.

    - If you're unsure if a user should continue to have access, you can select Don't know. The user gets to keep their access, and your choice is recorded in the audit logs.

1. **Review access based on recommendations** - Follow the below steps

    -  Click on **Details** next to the access review.
     
    - To make access reviews easier and faster for you, Azure provides recommendations that you can accept with a single selection. There are two ways that the system generates recommendations for the reviewer. One method is by the user's sign-in activity. If a user has been inactive for 30 days or more, the system recommends that the reviewer deny access.

    - The other method is based on the access that the user's peers have. If the user doesn't have the same access as their peers, the system recommends that the reviewer deny that user access.

    - If you have No sign-in within 30 days or Peer outlier enabled, follow these steps to accept recommendations:

    - Select one or more users, and then select Accept recommendations Or to accept recommendations for all unreviewed users, make sure that no users are selected and then select the Accept recommendations button on the top bar.

    - Select Submit to accept the recommendations.

    >**IMPORTANT**

      - You can create either an allow list or a deny list. You canâ€™t set up both types of lists. By default, whatever domains are not in the allow list are on the deny list, and vice versa.
      - You can create only one policy per organization. You can update the policy to include more domains, or you can delete the policy to create a new one.
      - The number of domains you can add to an allow list or deny list is limited only by the size of the policy. The maximum size of the entire policy is 25 KB (25,000 characters), which includes the allow list or deny list and any other parameters configured for other features.
      - This list works independently from OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online allow/block lists. If you want to restrict individual file sharing in SharePoint Online, you need to set up an allow or deny list for OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online.
      - The list does not apply to external users who have already redeemed the invitation. The list will be enforced after the list is set up. If a user invitation is in a pending state, and you set a policy that blocks their domain, the userâ€™s attempt to redeem the invitation will fail.

1. When finished, **save** your changes.
