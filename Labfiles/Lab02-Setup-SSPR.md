### Task 4: Run AD Sync

*Note that this step is normally not necessary for password writeback, but is recommended to address issues inherent in lab environments and ensure AD DS is synchronized with Azure AD.*

    ```

4. Close Windows PowerShell, and then wait for approximately 3-4 minutes.

### Task 5: Verify password writeback

1. Switch to **HOSTVM** and sign in to **SEA-CL1**.

   >**Note** : If you are unable to sign in to SEA-CL1, then turnoff the Hyper-V VM's which are not being used in this lab from the HyperV-Manager which is available in the HOSTVM and then try to sign in to SEA-CL1.

   >**Note** : Before proceeding with the next step, ensure that you are in basic session mode and able to view Clipboard in the menu bar as shown in the below image. If not please change it to the basic session by selecting the icon which was highlighted in the tool bar in the below image.

2. On **SEA-CL1**, select **Other user**, and then attempt to sign in as **Contoso\\Aaron** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

3. Ensure that you get the message that the user name or password is incorrect.

4. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\Aaron** with the password **Pa55w.rd1234!**. 

   > You should be able to sign in. This confirms that the password you changed in the Azure portal is written back to the local Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) account.

5. Sign out of **SEA-CL1**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured and validated self-service password reset.
